0.0.1 March 2017
First working version

0.0.2 May 2017
Complete re-implementation, with the following improvements:
* libcurl is now linked, rather than invoking the curl utility via the
  operating system shell. This gives much better reporting of errors
* The use of trailing slashes on directory/folder names now has the same
  semantics as in rsync. There is no longer a requirement to signal that
  a path should be treated as a folder by appending a /. However, sometimes
  it is still useful to do so
* delete command now supports wildcard searches
* get and put now support multiple source arguments on the command line,
  each of which may expand to mutliple files and directories if
  wildcards are used

0.0.3 May 2017
* Implemented large file upload, using block transfers with selectable
  block size
* Implemented wildcard search for 'list' command
* Tidied up error reporting
* Implemented "usage" command
* Implemented progress indicator during upload and download

<h1>dbcmd</h1>

Version 0.0.1, March 2017

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<code>dbcmd</code> is a very simple command-line utility for Linux,
for uploading files to, and downloading them from, the Dropbox server.
It can list files on the server and retrieve their meta-data,
delete files and rename them. In its purposes, it is a little like
<code>rsync</code>.
<p/>
<code>dbcmd</code> uses the Dropbox published HTTP API for all
its server operations. It is written entirely in C, and has no
dependencies except <code>curl</code>, and standard Linux commands.
It was written specifically for embedded systems that cannot run the
Dropbox proprietary client, and do not have the dependencies needed
to use any of the proprietary API libraries. It will run on Linux desktop
systems too, but there is less need for it in such an environment.
In particular, I wrote it to use on ARM-based Chromebooks, which can't
run the proprietary client, and don't have storage to synchronize an
entire Dropbox account even if they could. 
<p/>
In fact, <code>dbcmd</code> is not an appropriate tool for
synchronizing a complete Dropbox account (unless there are only a 
few files). Synchronization using the HTTP API is very slow and, if
there are many files, will use a great deal of memory. 
<p/>
Rather, <code>dbcmd</code> is intended to be used to copy files
from the server, work on them, and then copy changes back to the server. 

<h2>Usage examples</h2>

<pre class="codeblock">
# List the contents of a folder on the Dropbox server 
dbcmd list /docs/accounts/

# Download files from the /docs/accounts/ folder to a local directory
dbcmd --recursive get /docs/accounts/ accounts/

# Upload changed files from the local directory to the server
dbcmd put --recursive accounts/ /docs/accounts/

# Rename a file
dbcmd rename /docs/accounts/may207.doc /docs/accounts/may2017.doc

# Delete a Dropbox folder without prompting for confirmation 
dbcmd --yes /docs/accounts/temp/
</pre>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<code>dbcmd</code> is designed to run on modern Linux systems. 
It uses <code>curl</code>, which must be installed. 
To read the manual pages you will need the <code>man</code> utility and
its dependencies (particularly <code>groff</code>). These utilities are likely
to be present in all Linux distributions except, perhaps, those for
embedded systems.

<h2>Building</h2>

The usual:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

A constant <code>CURL_EXTRA</code> is defined in
<code>src/curl.h</code>. You might need to edit this to speecify particular arguments
to pass to curl, such as the location of the trusted certificates file.

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<code>man dbcmd</code> is a good place to start. Individual commands have their
own manual pages, which can be shown, for example, like this:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ dbcmd help get 
</pre>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

Like all applications that use Dropbox's public API, <code>dbcmd</code> 
authentication uses the OAUTH2 
protocol, which provides the application with a token that authorizes
it on the server. The first time you run <code>dbcmd</code> you will see
this message: 

<pre class="codeblock">
Please enter this URL into your browser, and allow dbcmd
to get access to your Dropbox files: 

https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=yorayt4h2bxk8x3

Then enter the authorization code here: 
</pre>

Following the link in a browser will take you to the Dropbox authorization page,
where you can select to authorize this utility. Authorization will provide a string
of numbers and letters which you should enter (or cut and paste) 
at the prompt. This string is not the authorization token itself, but is converted
into one by a further API operation. 
The token is then stored in a file <code>$HOME/.dbcmd_token</code>. Some care needs to
be taken with this file because the token can be used to impersonate you
on the Dropbox server -- not easily, but it can be done by a person with sufficient
knowledge of the Dropbox protocols.
<p/>
The token can be revoked at any time using the Dropbox website. If this happens,
and it is not intentional, then you can use the <code>--auth</code> switch
with any <code>dbcmd</code> command to restart the authorization process.

<h2>General notes</h2>

<h3>Dropbox folder naming</h3>

Dropbox folder names <i>must</i> start a forward-slash, and components are
separated by further foward-slashes, as in Unix. In principle, 
the Dropbox API uses an empty string to signify the top-level folder (which
is actually quite logical) but
this utility expects an ordinary Unix forward-slash. The <code>get</code> and
<code>put</code> commands require that a trailing forward-slash be used to 
signify that you intend to transfer too or from a folder. For example,
the name <code>/test</code>
denotes a file called <code>test</code> in the root folder, and <i>not</i> a
folder called <code>/test/</code>. This is true whether there actually
is a folder with
this name or not. There is a little more leniency in the use of local directory
names, because the utility can easily tell whether a name refers to a file or a
directory. This requirement -- indicating a folder using a trailing slash --
is not a limitation of Dropbox (in fact, folder names <i>can't</i> end in a 
forward slash) -- it just saves <code>dbcmd</code> a further trip to the server
to work out whether you are referring to a file or a folder. 

<h3>Recursive transfers</h3>

The <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> commands have a <code>--recursive</code> 
switch, that indicates to upload or download from subfolders. It is important to
realize that, unlike <code>rsync</code> or the Linux <code>cp</code> utility,
recursive transfers can be used with a specific fimename of file pattern.
For example

<pre class="codeblock">
dbcmd put --recursive $HOME/images/*.jpg /images/
</pre>

will copy all files in <code>$HOME/images</code> that match the pattern <code>*.jpg</code>,
creating folders on the server as necessary to maintain the same directory structure.
<p/>
It is also important to bear in mind that recursive transfers of large numbers of
files will take a long time, and use a great deal of memory, because complete
file lists have to be contructed, along with hash values for each file, and passed
over the wire.


<h3>Dropbox timestamps</h3>

Dropbox synchronization does not work by comparing timestamps -- it compares
file hashes. You can, in principle, upload a file to the server that has the
same hash as an existing file, but <i>the timestamp of the file on the server
is not changed</i> if you do. Attempting to use timestamps for synchronization is
thus rather problematic. 
<p/>
Dropbox stores two timestamps for each file -- as "server timestamp" and a
"client timestamp". The server timestamp is the time at which the file
was uploaded to the server. The client timetamp is not managed by Dropbox,
and can be set to anything. It could, in principle, be set to the timestamp
of the file on the local filesystem, and used for synchronization.
However, other Dropbox clients do not use the client timestamp -- not, at least,
in any consistent way; so it cannot be relied upon (and is not explicitly set by
the proprietary client).
<p/>
So, in practice, using <code>dbcmd</code> to synchronize files between clients
sharing the same Dropbox account will result in them being considered
"in sync" when all files have the same local timestamp as the server
timestamp. This is the same behaviour as the proprietary Dropbox client
implements. 
<p/>
Calculating hashes takes much, much longer than checking a timestamp, but is
a more reliable way to tell whether two files are different or not.
However, this extra time makes synchronization a longer operation than it would be
if we could just check timestamps.


<h2>Bugs and limitations</h2>

The largest file that can be uploaded to the Dropbox server is
<b>150Mb</b>. This is a limitation of the Dropbox HTTP API.
<p/>
There is no limit -- other than time and memory -- on the number of files 
that can be listed, searched, or copied in one 
operation. However, since most operations first 
require building a list of files held on the server and the local
filesystem, and their hash values, and because Dropbox delivers its file
lists relatively slowly, it is impractical to work on huge sets of
files.
<p/>
The file containing the stored authorization token is not encrypted. It could be encrypted,
but this would require asking the user for a decryption key or password on 
every operation, which would be a nuisance.
<p/>
Dropbox does not store Linux file attributes -- not even the owner's permissions.
Files retrieved by <code>dbcmd</code> will usually have 644 permissions, regardless
of what they had when the file was uploaded. 
<p/>
The Dropbox API is not particularly detailed in its error responses. Something
that <code>dbcmd</code> reports as a permissions problem could relate to
a revoked authorization token, or just to an incorrect pathname on the server.
<p/>
File upload and download operations report the number of successful operations,
the number of errors, and the number of files that were skipped because
they were up to date. However, <code>dbcmd</code> is unable to report
errors that are known only to <code>curl</code>, and not reported by it. 
Some kinds of failed uploads and downloads fall into that category. You should
still see an error message (from <code>curl</code>), but the success and failure
counts might be incorrect.
<p/>
Dropbox has a notion of file versions, and can retain deleted or modified
versions of the same file. <code>dbcmd</code> does not provide access to
previous versions or deleted files.
<p/>
Dropbox supports the use of multiple collaborators with access to the same
file. Dropbox won't stand in the way of such operations, but does not
(indeed can not) report who the owner of a file is, or indicate what 
permissions the user has on that file. It can't be used to change sharing behaviour.

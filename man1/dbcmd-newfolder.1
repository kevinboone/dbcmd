.SH NAME
Create a new folder on the Dropbox server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbcmd 
newfolder\ [options]\ {remote_paths...} 
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdbcmd newfolder\fR creates one or more new folders on the Dropbox server.

.SH EXAMPLE

.BI dbcmd\ newfolder\ /docs/accounts/march

.SH "OPTIONS"

See main manual page.

.SH NOTES

.SS Directory naming 

The remote path must begin with '/'. As it can only be a directory, it does not
matter whether it ends with a '/' or not.

.SS Authentication

This utility, like all that use the Dropbox API, uses token-based
authentication against the Dropbox server. It will prompt for a token
the first time it is executed, and store the token for future use.
See 
.SS \fIdbcmd(1)\fR 
for more details.

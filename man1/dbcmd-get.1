.TH dbcmd-get 1 "March 2017"
.SH NAME
Download files from Dropbox
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbcmd 
get\ [options]\ {remote_path}\ [local_path]
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdbcmd get\fR retrieves one or more files from the Dropbox server, 
attempting to maintain the server's folder structure in the local
directory. The 
\fIremote-path\fR argument can specify a single file, a folder, or
a file pattern with wildcards. Unless a single file is specified, the
\fI[local-path]\fR argument must denote a local directory that already
exists. If this argument is omitted, the default is the current directory. 

This command will not retrieve files which have the same SHA-256 hash as
they have on the server -- these are deemed to be unchanged. It will never
delete local files that don't have counterparts on the server -- files
are only ever added.  

This command is not intended to synchronize an entire Dropbox account
-- there are limits to the number of files that can be searched on
Dropbox in a single operation. Rather it is intended to obtain
particular files or folders for local viewing or modification.

.SH EXAMPLE

.BI dbcmd\ -r\ get\ /docs/accounts/*.doc\ accounts/ 

Download files the match pattern \fI*.doc\fR from \fI/docs/accounts\fR on the 
Dropbox server, and any of its subfolders, 
and copy them to the local directory \fIaccounts\fR, maintaining
the same structure.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI -a,\-\-auth
Force a re-authentication against the Dropbox server, and get a new
authentication token. The token is stored in 
\fI$HOME/.dbcmdr_token\rR.
.LP
.TP
.BI -r,\-\-recursive
Download folders recursively
.LP

.SH NOTES

.SS Directory naming 

Directory names that refer to Dropbox folders \fImust\fR end in a forward
slash (/). This is true even if the folder exists. Failing to append the
forward slash will result in trying to fetch a single file, rather than
the contents of a folder. 

Unlike \fIrsync(1)\fR, this utility will accept file wildcard characters in
a folder expansion (as shown in the example above). Only files matching
the pattern will be copied.

.SS File list limit

There is a limit to the number of files that can be considered for 
download using this command -- regardless of the number that are
actually downloaded. The limit is not well-documented, but it appears
to be over one thousand.

.SS Timestamps

The timestamp set on the file will be the time it is written to the local
filesystem. No attempt is made to synchronize timestamps, because the
Dropbox sync process uses hashes, not timestamps, to determine whether
a file is up to date.

.SS Authentication

This utility, like all that use the Dropbox API, uses token-based
authentication against the Dropbox server. It will prompt for a token
the first time it is executed, and store the token for future use.

.SS \fIdbcmd(1)\fR
